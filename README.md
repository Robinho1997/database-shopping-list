# database-shopping-list https://futtercheck.netlify.app 

I created a shopping-list app which i can use as a shortcut on my phone homescreen so i dont forget what groceries i need to buy in the future!

I hooked this simple React Application with the Firebase Realtime Database up.

With the realtime database I can sync the data even over various devices.

You can type in the input field and on the button click the value of the input field gets pushed to my reference in my database.

If you click on an item a function checks for the key of that specific item in the database and removes it then.

Love firebase such a cool platform!
